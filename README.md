## Here's an example program in R that calculates a person's age and the number of days until their next birthday:

## This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a MacOs XCode IDE or code editor environment and follow the prompts.

## Version 1.0
## Here's an implementation of the age calculation program in Objective-C: This program uses NSDate and NSDateComponents to perform the age and next birthday calculations. The input is read from the console using NSFileHandle and NSString. The output is printed to the console using NSLog.
